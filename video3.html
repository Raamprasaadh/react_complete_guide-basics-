      <!-- 
          - in this we have used a different import method to import react js (using script without 
            installing using npm) the UNPKG.com
          - instead of document .createELement we are using the React.createElement();
           - for createElement method the first parameter is the type of element div, span, etc..
           - for createElement method the second parameter is an object which contains children and class Name properties.
           - the children can be an array and what are the elements present in children will be displayed in the element
           - className will be applied to the element being created
          -  and we are using the ReactDOM.render method to inject the element created to the root element
            - the ReactDOM.render() method takes two parameters first one is the element to be injected, second one is the element to which we should inject first one.

            the result of this video is as same as the video 2 but we achieved it using react in children of createElement method we can append more childs
            it is easy to mani[pulate the dom further to the element we have created
       -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
        const element = React.createElement("div",{
            children:["Hello World"],
            className:"container"
        })
        ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);

    </script>
  </body>
